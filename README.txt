Hartzog Creative Skel Framework
===============================

The Skel Framework is a `Django <http://djangoproject.com/>`_ project that
can be used out of the box as a stand-alone web app, or as the starting 
point for a custom solution. Various default applications are included as 
well as tools for creating customized installs. To get started, simply run 
``python setup.py install``, then ``skel-admin.py startproject <projectname>``. 
If you'd prefer a demo, you can try out the development server with 
``python setup.py demo``.
